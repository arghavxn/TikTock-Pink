# TikTock Pink - Real-Time Analog Clock 🕰️🎀

## Description
**TikTock Pink** is a beautifully designed real-time analog clock built with **Python, Matplotlib, and NumPy**. It features smooth animated clock hands, a pastel pink aesthetic, and updates in real time using your system's local time.

## Features
- ⏳ **Smooth animated clock hands**  
- 🎨 **Elegant pastel pink theme**  
- 🕒 **Real-time updates based on local time**  
- 🖥️ **Built with Matplotlib’s FuncAnimation**  
- ⏰ **Displays hour, minute, and second hands**  

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before running the clock:
- **Python 3.6+**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **NumPy**  

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arghavxn/TikTock-Pink.git
   cd TikTock-Pink
Project Structure
TikTock-Pink/
│── clock.py             # Main script for the analog clock

How It Works

The clock updates every 40ms for a smooth animation effect.
Uses Matplotlib’s FuncAnimation to keep hands moving in real-time.
The clock face includes hour markers, minute ticks, and a stylish pastel design.
Reads the current system time and calculates precise hand angles dynamically.
